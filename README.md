## 1. Introduction
As a member in the climbing and mountaineering community (both in Thailand and UK), I have spent a lot of my time on Mountain Project website which is one of the largest websites about the climbing-related topics. It serves as a guidebook or climbing information database with more than 100k climbing routes across the globe. As a data analyst, this piques my curiosity about relationship between variety of climbing-related data from the website such as number of routes, route height, difficulty grades, etc. Therefore, this project aims to process the raw data in SQL Server and present the insights in Tableau dashboard.
